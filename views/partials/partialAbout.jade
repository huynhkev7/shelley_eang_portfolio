      span.emphasize Hello!
      |&nbsp;nice to meet you! I’m Shelley Eang (pronounced as “Aye-ng”) and I recently graduated from the University of Washington with a Bachelor of Science degree in Human Centered Design & Engineering with a focus in Human Computer Interaction. My passion for user experience design grew after seeing my non tech-savvy family members grow closer and more connected through real time video calls. Through my professional pursuit, I can help bring a better experience to those who want to gain connectivity through user-centered design.
