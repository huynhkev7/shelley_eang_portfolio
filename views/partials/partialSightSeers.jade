        .row
            p There are many existing travel applications that helps plan itineraries and documents photos and videos, though, many people often forget about the context behind the memory in which they are documenting onto social media. Based on web research, college students often do not travel due to financial constraints, however when given the opportunity, most college students like to share their experiences with their strong ties, such as their friends and family. Students also often forget about their memories when explaining to their family and friends, which results in living only in the moment.

            p Using the sitemap, my team divided sections of the system to allow each member to create designs for the paper prototype. My contributions included the administrative screen interfaces, such as the settings and getting started with atomiC. After sharing and discussing our sketches, we improved upon the designs to create a consistent look and feel for our concept.
        .row.sub-section-header Usability Tests
            .row
                p Results from the first usability test sessions were from the paper prototypes while the second was gathered using the high fidelity digital prototypes.
                p After conducting both usability tests, our team noticed a significant drop in average task time and mistakes along with a significant increase in usability and likeability rankings in the digital prototypes compared to the paper prototypes. My team used sticky notes and hand drawn prototypes to showcase our paper prototype. For our high fidelity designs, we designed our prototypes on Figma and used the POP app to showcase interactions.
                p A few positive findings:

        .row.sub-section-header The Solution
            p Through our competitive analysis and interviews, we were able to identify the following features that would meet the needs of our users:
            .row.sub-sub-section-header Accurate and automated data
                p By utilizing an individual’s Carbon Identification Number, atomiC will be able to provide the user with accurate data about their carbon emissions, without the hassle of manual inputs.
            .row.sub-sub-section-header Data analysis
                p Our system will present the user’s data to them in a meaningful, digestible way. Users will be able to utilize data visualizations, micro level reports, and macro level themes to learn about their carbon externalities.
            .row.sub-sub-section-header A breakdown of carbon externalities
                p Users will be able to learn about their overall carbon emissions, as well as their emissions within the four categories of food, goods, transit, and utilities. Within these categories, they can also see a breakdown of items within each category, such as gasoline for their personal vehicle.
            .row.sub-sub-section-header In-app notifications
                p Our system provides the user with notifications on how they can reduce their carbon output, as well as notifications for when they are nearing their allotment limit.
            .row.sub-sub-section-header Progress tracking
                p Our system allows users to track their weekly or monthly progress within the data section of atomiC to help increment their goal of reducing carbon emissions, making this daunting task feel manageable.
            .row.sub-sub-section-header Improvement coaching
                p Our system customizes suggestions for how the user can reduce their carbon emissions. Suggests range from the micro to macro level.
            .row.sub-sub-section-header Social Media
                p For externally motivated users, atomiC offers a social media component wherein they can compare their progress and emissions to the average or their friends.

        .row.section-header Future Considerations
            p The main objective of atomiC is to help residents of Washington track their carbon emissions. Future development on our project would largely focus on how to automatically track carbon emissions through different platforms outside of a mobile application. One way to do this is to monitor utility emissions through home appliances and allow users to control the power from their mobile application if they are near their carbon emissions.
            p Going forward, we would like to add more tracking capabilities outside of a mobile application, although keep with our initial goal of tracking carbon emissions and not overwhelming our users.
