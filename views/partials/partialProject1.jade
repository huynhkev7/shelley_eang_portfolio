    .row
        p For 2 quarters (20 weeks), I worked in a team of four undergraduate students to create a card game prototype to teach college students about earthquake recovery. The idea was proposed to my team by our sponsor, Scott Miles from The Center for Collaborative Systems for Security, Safety, and Regional Resilience (CoSSaR).
